Jun 06 14:32:45 server-01 sshd[1249]: Failed password for invalid user admin from 192.168.1.100 port 58632 ssh2

This log message was generated on June 6th at 14:32:45 by the SSH daemon (sshd) running on server-01. It indicates that there was an attempt to log in with the username "admin" from the IP address 192.168.1.100 on port 58632. However, the login attempt failed because the password provided was incorrect.

## Explanation for Line 3:
Uncaught Exception: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name') at /app/server.js:45:12

This log message indicates that an uncaught exception occurred in the code at line 45, column 12 of the file "server.js". The exception is a TypeError, which means that the code attempted to read a property ('name') from an object that is undefined. This type of error typically occurs when trying to access a property of an object that does not exist or has not been properly initialized. In this case, the code is trying to access the 'name' property of an undefined object, resulting in the error. To fix this issue, you need to ensure that the object is properly defined before trying to access its properties.


## Explanation for Line 4:
Warning  BackOff  1m (x5 over 5m)  kubelet Back-off restarting failed container

This log message indicates a warning from the Kubernetes kubelet component. The message "BackOff" suggests that the kubelet is experiencing issues with restarting a failed container. 

The "1m" indicates that the kubelet is waiting for 1 minute before attempting to restart the container again. The "(x5 over 5m)" part means that the container has failed multiple times (5 times) within a 5-minute period.

Overall, this log message is informing you that the kubelet is having difficulty restarting a container that has repeatedly failed within a short period of time.


## Explanation for Line 5:
Traceback (most recent call last): File "main.py", line 22, in <module> result = process(data) File "main.py", line 10, in process return data['key'] TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable

This log is a traceback message from a Python program. It indicates that an error occurred during the execution of the program. Here's a breakdown of the log message:

1. "Traceback (most recent call last)": This line indicates that the following lines will show the traceback of the error, starting from the most recent function call.

2. "File "main.py", line 22, in <module>": This line specifies the file name and line number where the error occurred. In this case, the error occurred in the "main.py" file at line 22, which is inside the main module.

3. "result = process(data)": This line shows the code that caused the error. The program was trying to assign the result of calling the "process" function with the "data" variable.

4. "File "main.py", line 10, in process": This line indicates that the error occurred inside the "process" function, which is defined in the "main.py" file at line 10.

5. "return data['key']": This line shows the specific line of code where the error occurred. The program was trying to access the value associated with the key 'key' in the 'data' dictionary.

6. "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable": This is the actual error message. It indicates that the program tried to access an item in a dictionary, but the variable 'data' was of type 'NoneType', which is not subscriptable (i.e., it cannot be indexed like a dictionary).

In summary, the error occurred because the program was trying to access a key in a dictionary that was actually set to None, leading to a TypeError.
